Cronosync
==============

A Node app to synchronise Facebook events with your Calendar using the Cronofy API - doesn't actually work yet!

Steps to run the app
=====================
* After cloning the repo, install the dependencies by running **npm install**
* To start the server, run **npm start** on the base directory

Perquisites
============
The server assumes that you have a local mongo instance running. This means if you have mongo installed locally, all you need to do is configure the environment variables (see db.js) correctly and run the mongod daemon
